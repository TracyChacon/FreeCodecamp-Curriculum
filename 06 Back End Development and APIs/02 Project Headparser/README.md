# Request Header Parser Microservice

This code parses the request header and returns the ip address, preferred language, and software used.

## Competencies

Knowledge of Express: Express is a web framework for Node.js. It is used to create web applications and APIs.
Knowledge of the req and res objects: The req object contains information about the request, such as the IP address of the user, the headers that were sent with the request, and the body of the request. The res object is used to send a response to the user.

## Summary

This code is a Express route that handles requests to the /api/whoami path. This path is an API endpoint that returns a JSON object with the user's IP address, preferred language, and software name.

The IP address is obtained from the req.ip property, the preferred language is obtained from the req.headers['accept-language'] property, and the software name is obtained from the req.headers['user-agent'] property.

The JSON object is then returned to the client using the res.json() method.
