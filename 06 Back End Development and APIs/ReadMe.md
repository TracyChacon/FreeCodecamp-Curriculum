## Description

These are my microservice solutions using JavaScript, Node.js, Mongoose, and Express.

[Timestamp Microservice](https://github.com/TracyChacon/Projects-freeCodeCamp.org/tree/master/06%20Back%20End%20Development%20and%20APIs/01%20Project%20Timestamp%20Microservice) - A timestamp microservice that gets the Unix timestamp and UTC string for a given date.

[Request Header Parser Microservice](https://github.com/TracyChacon/Projects-freeCodeCamp.org/tree/master/06%20Back%20End%20Development%20and%20APIs/02%20Project%20Headparser) - A request header parser microservice that parses the request headers from an HTTP request.

[URL Shortener Microservice](https://github.com/TracyChacon/Projects-freeCodeCamp.org/tree/master/06%20Back%20End%20Development%20and%20APIs/03%20Project%20URL%20Shortener%20Microservice) - A URL shortener is a service that takes a long URL and creates a shorter, more memorable version of it. Very useful to make URLs easier to type and remember, to fit long URLs into social media posts or text messages, track the number of clicks on a link, or prevent spam and phishing attacks.
