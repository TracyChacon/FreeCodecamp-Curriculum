## Description

These are my microservice solutions using JavaScript, Node.js, Mongoose, and Express.

[Timestamp Microservice](https://github.com/TracyChacon/Projects-freeCodeCamp.org/tree/master/06%20Back%20End%20Development%20and%20APIs/01%20Project%20Timestamp%20Microservice) - A timestamp microservice that gets the Unix timestamp and UTC string for a given date.

[Request Header Parser Microservice](https://github.com/TracyChacon/Projects-freeCodeCamp.org/tree/master/06%20Back%20End%20Development%20and%20APIs/02%20Project%20Headparser) - A request header parser microservice that parses the request headers from an HTTP request.

[URL Shortener Microservice](https://github.com/TracyChacon/Projects-freeCodeCamp.org/tree/master/06%20Back%20End%20Development%20and%20APIs/03%20Project%20URL%20Shortener%20Microservice) - A URL shortener is a service that takes a long URL and creates a shorter, more memorable version of it. Very useful to make URLs easier to type and remember, to fit long URLs into social media posts or text messages, track the number of clicks on a link, or prevent spam and phishing attacks.


[Exercise Tracker Application](https://github.com/TracyChacon/Projects-freeCodeCamp.org/tree/master/06%20Back%20End%20Development%20and%20APIs/04%20Project%20Exercise%20Tracker) - This project showcases my proficiency in building a comprehensive exercise tracking application using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and the MVC architecture, demonstrating expertise in backend, frontend, and database management.

[File Metadata Microservice](https://github.com/TracyChacon/Projects-freeCodeCamp.org/tree/master/06%20Back%20End%20Development%20and%20APIs/05%20Project%20File%20Metadata%20Microservice) - A file metadata microservice application that allows users to upload files, extracts their metadata (original filename, mimetype, and size), and displays the extracted information. It utilizes Express for routing, Multer for file handling, and HTML for the user interface.
