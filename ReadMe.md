## Ensuring  Project Success by Fulfilling User Stories
The above are links to projects that illustrate my skills in troubleshooting, executing what I learned to solve problems, and finding solutions to unexpected challeges. For these projects user stories were given and the developer implements the solutions. Within each link are explanations of the technologies used and brief lists that express skills that were needed to complete the projects.
