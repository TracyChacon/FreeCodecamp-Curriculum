# Ensuring Project Success by Fulfilling User Stories

The above are links to projects I completed that demonstrate my skills in troubleshooting, executing what I learned to solve problems, and finding solutions to unexpected challeges. For these projects user stories were given and the developer implements the solutions.

Within each link below are projects, explanations what technologies were used, and brief a summary of the project that illustate skills that were needed to complete the projects. Also, here is a link to my [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/tracychacon) profile.
