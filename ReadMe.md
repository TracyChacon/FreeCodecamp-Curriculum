## Ensuring  project success by fulfilling user stories
Above are links to projects that illustrate my skills in troubleshooting, executing what I learned to solve problems, and finding solutions to unexpected challeges. For these projects user stories were given and the developer implements the solutions. 

Below are explanations of the technologies used and brief lists that express skills that were needed to complete the projects. 

### Relational Database and Shell Scripting
PostgreSQL is a powerful and open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). It is known for its reliability, scalability, and security. PostgreSQL can be used to store and manage a wide variety of data, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. Shell scripting is a way of automating tasks on a Unix-like operating system.

### Project Competencies
Shell scripts are written in a scripting language called bash. Bash is a powerful language that can be used to perform a wide variety of tasks.
The prjects listed below deomonstrate my competence in:

- Running commands
- Processing text
- Manipulating files
- Interacting with users

Using shell scripting to add user interactivity to a PostgreSQL database can be done by creating a shell script that executes SQL queries and displays the results to the user. The projects below show my ability to create a shell script that allows users to:

- Create new tables
- Insert data into tables
- Update data in tables
- Delete data from tables
- Query data from tables
