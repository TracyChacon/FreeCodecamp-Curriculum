## Ensuring  Project Success by Fulfilling User Stories
The below are links to projects I completed ( [my freeCodeCamp.org profile](https://www.freecodecamp.org/tracychacon) ) that illustrate my skills in troubleshooting, executing what I learned to solve problems, and finding solutions to unexpected challeges. For these projects user stories were given and the developer implements the solutions. Within each link below are explanations of the technologies used and brief lists that express skills that were needed to complete the projects.
