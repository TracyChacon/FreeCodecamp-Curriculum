## Technology Descriptions: Relational Database and Shell Scripting
PostgreSQL is a powerful and open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). It is known for its reliability, scalability, and security. PostgreSQL can be used to store and manage a wide variety of data, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. Shell scripting is a way of automating tasks on a Unix-like operating system.

## Project Competencies
Shell scripts are written in a scripting language called bash. Bash is a powerful language that can be used to perform a wide variety of tasks.
The prjects listed below deomonstrate my competence in:

- Running commands
- Processing text
- Manipulating files
- Interacting with users

Using shell scripting to add user interactivity to a PostgreSQL database can be done by creating a shell script that executes SQL queries and displays the results to the user. The projects below show my ability to create a shell script that allows users to:

- Create new tables
- Insert data into tables
- Update data in tables
- Delete data from tables
- Query data from tables
